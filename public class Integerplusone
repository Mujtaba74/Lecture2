		a++; // ++ is used to add the value of 1 to any number. In this case it adds one to the value of a which is 10, so 10+1 is 11. After this a should be printed as having the value of 11 and not 10.
		System.out.println("The value of a plus one is "+ a + "."); // Printing a here gives the output of 11 because of the increment operator written in the previous line of code.
